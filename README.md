# CCDC_Prep_2021_Ecommerce
Most material here will be geared towards CCDC Documentation, Linux Server Hardening, Debian 9 / CentOS 7 quirks and other related things. The Ecommerce box (Running MySQL, Apache and Wordpress, more specifically.)

#Quick guide

# (CentOS 7 variant) roadmap [SOMEWHAT DATED; USE DEBIAN 9 VARIANT PREFERABLY] - A guide to hardening a CentOS 7 server. Filled with useful commands, 
# tricks, etc. to get the job done right and fast.

# (Debian 9 variant) roadmap - Pretty much what the CentOS 7 file was, but with edits for Debian 9's quirks, package manager, unique file locations, etc. 
# Also fixed some missing parts from the older CentOS 7 doc.

# (Debian 9 services) - Contains useful how-to guides for setting up the expected services for the ecomm box. (KEEP IN MIND IF YOU'RE A STUDENT USING THIS GUIDE: The competition
# pretty much always shuffles up the services and there are no guarantees the services listed in here will be exactly the same.)

# Linux Blue Team Flowchart.png - A pleasing visual box flowchart for locking down most Linux Services on the basic level.  

# Crontab automation and backups [INCOMPLETE] - A guide for working with crontabs, BASH scripts and learning how to backup files in Linux.   

# httpd_ccdc_config.conf - A configuration file more secure than the initial config file for apache. Be sure to name the config file properly for the given Linux distro.

# ssl_ccdc_config.conf - A configuration file more secure than the initial config file for enabling HTTPS services. Once again, be sure to name the config file properly.
